`cd ..`

# Installing Python

Anaconda Distribution for Python - will install the language and all sorts of useful tools. 

Jupiter notebook - tools we use in the course. 

Think of Anaconda Navigator as your "home" for launching environments for running Python code. We will use it to launch Jupyter Notebook, our main coding environment for the course!

For a mac `anaconda-navigator` from the terminal launches the anaconda navigator.

A Jupyter environment is essentially an environment where you can write individual cells of Python code.

Can `run` cells in notebook. Can also press *Shift + Enter* to run it on the command line. Main way we'll be learning how to program throughout the course. 

# Running Python Code 

There are several ways to run Python code.

3 main types of environments - text editors, full IDE's and Notebook environments. 

To run the script file from terminal run (in VS code - not the terminal): 

`python script.py` or name of whatever the file name is. 

In Jupyter notebooks - ipynb stands for 'i python notebook'.

Notebook system can also hold markdown text. If you want to make it into a normal markdown cell, select from the drowpdown markdown, and it will just have normal text in it. Will no longer have the `In []` in front of the cell. And if you press shift + enter, it displays as a normal text. 

The special file name means you can't double click on the file and open it. Can double click on .py files, but can't on a .ipynb file. Get scrambled code, or other output. Can only open it through the Jupyter system.
