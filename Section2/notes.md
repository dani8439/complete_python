# Installing Python

Anaconda Distribution for Python - will install the language and all sorts of useful tools. 

Jupiter notebook - tools we use in the course. 

Think of Anaconda Navigator as your "home" for launching environments for running Python code. We will use it to launch Jupyter Notebook, our main coding environment for the course!

For a mac `anaconda-navigator` from the terminal launches the anaconda navigator.

A Jupyter environment is essentially an environment where you can write individual cells of Python code.

Can `run` cells in notebook. Can also press *Shift + Enter* to run it on the command line. Main way we'll be learning how to program throughout the course.
