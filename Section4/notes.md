# Comparison Operators in Python 

| Operator |	Description	| Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
|==|	If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true. |	(a == b) is not true. |
| !=|If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	| (a != b) is true |
| >	|If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	| (a > b) is not true.|
|<	|If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	|(a < b) is true.|
| >=	|If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	|(a >= b) is not true.|
|<=	|If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	|(a <= b) is true.|
