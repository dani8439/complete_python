# Comparison Operators in Python 

| Operator |	Description	| Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
|==|	If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true. |	(a == b) is not true. |
| !=|If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	| (a != b) is true |
| >	|If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	| (a > b) is not true.|
|<	|If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	|(a < b) is true.|
| >=	|If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	|(a >= b) is not true.|
|<=	|If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	|(a <= b) is true.|

```python
# Equality 
2 == 2 
# True 

2 == 1
# False 
# Single equals means assignment, not comparison 

'hello' == 'bye' 
# False 

'2' == 2 
# False 

2.0 == 2 
# True 

# Inequality 
3 != 3 
# False 

4 != 5
# True 

# Greater than 
2 > 1 
# True 

1 > 2 
# False 

# Less Than 
1 < 2 
# True 

2 < 5 
# True 

# Greater than or equal to

2 >= 2 
# True 

# Less than or Equal To 
4 <= 1 
# False
