# If, elif, else statements 

- Let's begin to learn about **control flow**. Control flow allows us to use logic to execute code only when we want to. 
- We often only want certain code to execute when a particular condition has been met. 
- For example, **if** my dog is hungry (some condition) then I will feed the dog (some action).

- To control this flow of logic we use some keywords:
    - **if**
    - **elif** 
    - **else**

- Control syntax makes use of colons and indentations (whitespace).
- This indentation system is crucial to Python and is what sets it apart from other programming languages.
