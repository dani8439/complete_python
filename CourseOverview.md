# Why Python? 

Created in 1990 by Guido van Rossum.
Python 3 released in 2008.

Specifically designed as an easy to use language.
High focus on readability of code. 

Why Choose Python?
- Designed for clear logical code that is easy to read and learn.
- Lots of exisiting libraries and frameworks written in Python allowing users to apply Python to a wide variety of tasks. 

- Focuses on optimizicing developer time, rather than a computer's processing time. 
- Great documentation online: `docs.python.org/3`

What can you dow tih Python?
- This course first focuses on "base" Python, which consists of the core components of the language and writing scrips and small programs. 
- Later we begin to learn about outside libraries and frameworks that greatly expand Python's capabilities. 

What can you do wtih Python? 
- Automate simple tasks 
Search for files and editing them
Scrape info from a website
Read and edit excel files
Work with PDFs
Automate emails and text messages 
Fill out forms

- Data Science and Machine Learning 
- Can analyze large data files 
- Create visualizations 
- Perform Machine learning tasks 
- Create and run predictive algorithms. 

Can also create websites 
- Use web frameworks such as Django and Flask to handle the backend of a website and user data 
- Create interactive dashboards for users.

Once you understand base Python and begin working with a few libraries, you'll quickly ebgin to see the vast potential Python has for your own projects.
