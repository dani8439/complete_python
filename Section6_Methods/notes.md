# Methods and Python Documentation 

## Methods
- Built-in objects in Python have a variety of methods you can use. 

```python
mylist = [1,2,3]

# some useful methods for lists, already seen .append(), .pop()

mylist.append(4)
mylist
# [1,2,3,4]
mylist.pop()
mylist
# [1,2,3]

# too many methods to go through for this course, otherwise hours and hours of video. But can discover methods on your own. In Jupyter noteback can hit . then tab once you've created an object and then see all the methods available. Can also use the help function. 

mylist.insert # shift tab after the method call and it will tell you what it is. 
# If not using jupyter notebook, can use the built in help function: help(mylist.insert) -- will return the doc string.

# third option is to view the python documention.
