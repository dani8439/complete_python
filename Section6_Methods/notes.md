# Methods and Python Documentation 

## Methods
- Built-in objects in Python have a variety of methods you can use. 

```python
mylist = [1,2,3]

# some useful methods for lists, already seen .append(), .pop()

mylist.append(4)
mylist
# [1,2,3,4]
mylist.pop()
mylist
# [1,2,3]

# too many methods to go through for this course, otherwise hours and hours of video. But can discover methods on your own. In Jupyter noteback can hit . then tab once you've created an object and then see all the methods available. Can also use the help function. 

mylist.insert # shift tab after the method call and it will tell you what it is. 
# If not using jupyter notebook, can use the built in help function: help(mylist.insert) -- will return the doc string.

# third option is to view the python documention. https://docs.python.org/3/
```

# Introduction to Functions
- Creating clean repeatable code is a key part of becomming an effective programmer
- **Functions** allow us to create blocks of code that can be easily executed many times, without needing to constantly rewrite the entire block of code. 
- Functions will be a huge leap forward in your capabilityes as a Python programmer. 
- This also means the problems you will solve can be a lot harder! 
- It is very important to get practice combining everything you've learned so far (control flow, loops, etc) with functions to become an effective programmer. 
- This may be a point in your progress where you may get discouraged or frustrated. Don't worry. This is completely normal and very common!
- We will guide you step by step, be patient with yourself and practice, practice, practice!!
